# maap-hec-aws

Project Overview:
This open-source project (NASA NPO-52250-1) will deliver a set of capabilities to NASA's Multi-Mission Algorithm and Analysis Platform (MAAP; https://github.com/MAAP-Project), which will allow seamless employment of the compute/storage capacity of both AWS and NASA High-End Computing Capability (HECC) for algorithm development and data processing and analysis. 

MAAP's Data Processing Services (DPS) approach of converting user-friendly Jupyter science notebooks to algorithm processing steps that run at scale will be updated to deploy seamlessly across AWS and NASA HECC. 

Forthcoming capabilities from this project will also enable deployment containerized algorithm workloads that are interoperable across AWS and Pleiades. The data management services will also be updated to enable automatic data migration between AWS storage and local storage on Pleiades. 

On-demand data products generated on both AWS and Pleiades will be ingested and managed by the MAAP Data Store for further exploitation from the MAAPs existing Algorithm Development Environment (ADE). A separate MAAP development system will be established to accommodate the changes required for AWS-NASA HEC infrastructure needs and to develop new capabilities. This system will then be tested and integrated into the future MAAP Ops/Production system. 

To continue the open science approach of the MAAP, this project will continue to make use of open source software developed under this task from the outset. Additionally, the utilization of science algorithm software used within the MAAP will continue to be open. The Jupyter notebooks developed under MAAP and run across AWS and NASA HECC will also be open.
